## Command Line Interface (CLI) Tutorial
The CLI is a medium in which the application interacts with the user, through text-based inputs. 
As **CookHub** mainly uses the CLI, this tutorial will equip you with the CLI fundamentals required for **CookHub**. However, if you are already familiar with the CLI, you can skip to the [Features](#features)
section to get started with our features.
This tutorial will give walk through the most fundamental commands to equip you with basic understanding of our command format.
First, let's look at the most basic command, the `add` command. A sample `add` command is shown below: <br>
```
add t/Cookies d/Yummy s/Mix the batter i/Flour, 30, grams, 0.20 
```
The first word of the command, `add`, tells **CookHub** that you have the intention of adding a recipe. Subsequently, the `t/` command flag
tells **CookHub** that the following words make up the *title* of the recipe. Hence, **CookHub** will recognise that the title of the recipe is 'Cookies'.
Then, the `d/` command flag signifies that 'Yummy' is the *description* of the recipe, and the `s/` command flag signifies that the sentences 'Mix the batter' is a *step* in the recipe. 
Lastly, the `i/` flag signifies that the recipe has *ingredient* 'Flour, 30, grams, 0.20'. 'Flour, 30, grams, 0.20' is to be interpreted as
30 grams of flour, in which it costs $0.20 for each gram of flour.

Another fundamental command is the `edit` command. A sample `edit` command is shown below: <br>
```
edit 1 d/Disgusting
```
This command has a similar format to the above `add` command, except that the `edit` is followed by a number. The number `1` signifies that 
you want to edit the first recipe in **CookHub**. Similarly to the `add` command, the `d/` flag signifies that the *description* of the recipe should be 'Disgusting'.
In essence, this command edits the description of the first recipe in **CookHub** to 'Disgusting'.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `lower_case` are commands or flags that must be typed literally.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are placeholder texts that are to be replaced by the user.
* Command flags (e.g. `t/`, `d/`) can be typed in any order
  - For example, the two commands below are the same, despite the swapped order of the command flags `t/` and `d/`
    - `add t/Corndogs d/Delicious i/Flour, 3.5, Cup, 0.30 s/Mix batter` 
    - `add d/Delicious t/Corndogs i/Flour, 3.5, Cup, 0.30 s/Mix batter`

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  - e.g  For the [add command](#add-a-recipe--add), `add t/Corndogs d/Delicious i/Flour, 3.5, Cup, 0.30 s/Mix batter` is a valid command, even though the command flag `tag/` is missing. 

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.
  - e.g. For the [add command](#add-a-recipe--add)`add t/Corndogs d/Delicious i/Flour, 3.5, Cup, 0.30 s/Mix batter s/Fry` is a valid command that has two `s/` flags

* *TITLE*, *DESCRIPTION*, *STEP*, *TAG* must be a word or sentence.
  - e.g. *TITLE* can be `I am a title`
  - e.g. *TAG* can be `Tag`

* *INGREDIENT* is of the format `INGREDIENT_NAME, QUANTITY, UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT, PRICE_PER_UNIT`
  - *INGREDIENT_NAME*, *QUANTITY*, *UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT*, *PRICE_PER_UNIT* are placeholder text meant to be replaced by the user following the below rules:
    - *INGREDIENT_NAME*, *UNIT_OF_MEASUREMENT* must be a word or sentence
    - *QUANTITY*, *PRICE_PER_UNIT* must be numeric
  - e.g. *INGREDIENT* can be `White wine vinegar, 2, tbsp, 0.10`
  - e.g. *INGREDIENT* can be `Large egg, 4, unit, 0.80`

* Ellipsis `...` attached directly behind a certain flag or parameter indicates that you can input multiple instances of that item.
