### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, 
`RecipeListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Recipe` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CookHubParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a recipe).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CookHubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CookHubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, `EditCommandParser`, `FindCommandParser`, `CookHubParser`) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* Stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both recipe book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RecipeBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* converts classes into their respective string formats in order to save them in json format

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recipebook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### What is it?
The `add` command is a fundamental feature of CookHub and it allows users to easily manage add recipes to their recipe book.
By typing this command with the correct command flags, users can add their own recipes, which contain the title, description, steps, ingredients, and tags.

#### Usage
The `add` command format is as shown below:

`add t/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION i/INGREDIENT... s/STEP... [tag/TAG]...`

The meanings of each prefix is as shown below:
- `t/` signifies the title of the recipe
- `d/` signifies the description of the recipe
- `i/` signifies the ingredient of the recipe
- `s/` signifies the step of the recipe
- `tag/` signifies the tag of the recipe

#### Implementation 
The add application mechanism is facilitated by the Ui, Logic and Model components of CookHub.

Given below are the steps that illustrate the interaction between the components when it receives a valid add
application command from the user.

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `AddCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for adding applications.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `AddCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `AddCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates respective recipe components.
7. The recipe components in turn make up a `Recipe` instance.
8. The newly created `Recipe` instance will then be used to create an `AddCommand`. This command instances
   is returned back to `LogicManager`.
9. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `AddCommand`. 
10. An instance of `CommandResult` is returned, signifying a successful command execution.
11. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

The sequence diagram for the `add` command is as shown below:
![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)



### Find feature

#### What is it? 
The `find` command helps users search recipes according to which component of the recipe they are looking for.

Users can find the application by using the command flags. The command flags specifies signifies which component
of a recipe you are searching through.


#### Usage 
The `find` command format is as shown below:

`find [r/RECIPE] [t/TITLE] [s/STEP] [i/INGREDIENT] [tag/TAG]`

The meaning of each prefix is as shown below:

- the flag `r/` searches through the entire recipe and its components
- the flag `t/` searches only through the recipe's title
- the flag `s/` searches only through the recipe's steps
- the flag `i/` seaches only through the recipe's ingredient names
- the flag `tag/` searches only through the recipe's tags

#### Implementation

1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `FindCommandParser`.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `FindCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `FindCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. A subtype of `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created depending on the different prefixes.
8. The `parse()` method will return a `FindCommand()` with the subtype of `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` as the parameter
9. This `FindCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `FindCommand`.
11. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` on `Model`.
12. `setCurrentPredicate(predicate)` called on `Model`. It updates the predicate that filters through the recipe list.
13. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
14. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.

The sequence diagram for the `find` command is as shown below:
![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


### Only feature

#### What is it?
The `only` feature helps users gather a list of recipes that can be made with only a limited set of ingredients.

Users can type in a list of ingredients. A list of recipes that can be made with those ingredients, or less will be displayed.

#### Usage 
The `only` command format is as shown below:

`only INGREDIENT...`

#### Implementation 
1. The Ui component receives the user command from the `CommandBox` of the GUI.
2. The command is passed to `LogicManager` via its `execute()` method.
3. The `LogicManager` passes the string input to the `CookHubParser` via the `parseCommand()` method.
4. The `CookHubParser` in turn creates an `OnlyCommandParser` that is responsible for the specific purpose of
   parsing user commands for finding applications.
5. The `CookHubParser` then passes the string input to the `OnlyCommandParser` via the `parse()` method.
6. The `OnlyCommandParser` then identifies the different prefixes in the string and creates a list of keywords.
7. A subtype of `RecipeIngredientsSubsetPredicate` is created depending on the different prefixes.
8. The `parse()` method will return a `OnlyCommand()` with `RecipeIngredientsSubsetPredicate` as the parameter
9. This `OnlyCommand` is returned back to `LogicManager`.
10. The `LogicManager` then calls the `execute()` method of the `OnlyCommand`. 
11. The current recipe book is updated by calling `updateFilteredRecipeList(predicate)` on `Model`.
12. `setCurrentPredicate(predicate)` called on `Model`. It updates the predicate that filters through the recipe list.
12. An instance of `CommandResult` is created which contains the information that will be displayed back to the User after
    the execution of the command.
13. The Ui component displays the contents of the `CommandResult` to the User.
    
The sequence diagram for the `only` command is as shown below:

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is `CookHub` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

**Use case: Add a recipe**

**MSS**

1. User requests to add in a recipe
2. CookHub continually prompts the user for each recipe instruction
3. User tells CookHub that he/she has finished typing in all the recipe instructions
4. CookHub stores the recipe, and shows a success message

   Use case ends.


**Use case: Delete a recipe**

**MSS**

1. User requests to list the recipe names
2. CookHub shows a list of recipe names
3. User requests to delete a recipe from the list using its index
4. CookHub deletes the recipe at the specified index
5. CookHub shows a success message

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The list is empty.

  Use case ends.

* 3a.  The specified index is invalid
   *  3a1. CookHub shows an error message

      Use case resumes at step 2


*{More to be added}*

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as there is Java 11 installed
2. Should be able to support almost 500 to 1000 recipes without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage, depending on the size of each recipe
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse
4. Should be able to be scalable to store more aspects of a recipe, or more functionalities, such as tagging, sorting, etc
5. Should not be required to handle pictures of recipes or ingredients
6. Should be usable to someone who is not familiar with command line interface

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. _{explain how to simulate a missing/corrupted file, and the expected behavior}_

1. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Appendix: Planned Enhancements

1. Filter by price after find function will only apply the filter on the subset of recipes that have been generated by the "find" function

2. After sorting recipes by price, calling the list function will reset the list to its original order

3. The find command when used on two separate ingredients (eg. egg and tomatoes) will find all the recipes that use either eggs or tomatoes and not recipes that include both egg and tomatoes.

4. Modify edit function such that user cannot change a recipe title to one that already exists in the RecipeBook regardless of casing in the letters of the title.

5. Restrict ingredient name and unit of measurement to only valid inputs and not random string input or numerical input

6. All the command words, flags and arguments such as (sort asc or desc) should be case insensitive.

7. We want to upgrade the find command such that it can also find by substrings and not just by the words. e.g. `find t/egg` should be able to find a recipe with the title 'eggs'

8. Allow ingredients prices to be more general, for example, olive oil that is bought by the bottle. Currently in CookHub, we only allow to the users to input the price by tablespoon, which is hard to calculate.

9. Allow find to work with multiple flags

10. Duplicate ingredients should not be allowed
