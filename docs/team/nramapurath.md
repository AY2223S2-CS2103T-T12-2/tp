### Project: MedInfo

MedInfo aims to solve the problem of slow, multiple step process of documenting patient medical records during in-processing and provide faster access to a particular patientâ€™s medical records for hospital admin staff.
The user interacts with MedInfo using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
MedInfo is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
