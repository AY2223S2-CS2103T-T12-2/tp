### Project: CookHub

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create GUI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view a detailed view of a recipe
  * What it does: allows the user to see a detailed view of a recipe one at a time. This can be done by 
    using the view {recipe no.} command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user needs to view the 
    details of the recipe such as instructions, cooking time and ingredients before starting to cook.

    * to be added soon
