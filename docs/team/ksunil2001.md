### Project: MedInfo

MedInfo aims to solve the problem of slow, multiple step process of documenting patient medical records during in-processing and provide faster access to a particular patientâ€™s medical records for hospital admin staff.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**

- **Enhancements to existing features**:
    - Fixed majority of the failing testcases
      - This was hard to fix for some testcases, as it required me to dig deep inside the code with the debugger to find the errors

      - Overall it was a time-consuming process
    - Updated json files for test cases
    - Refactored Person to Patient throughout the code
    - Fixed the display of ward name when editing a patient's details
    - Created a help.txt file to summarise the list of commands and their syntax

- **Documentation**:
    - Organised features by Patient, Ward and Utility in the User Guide
    - Updated the editward and addward command features in the User Guide
    - Added a use case for the find command in the Developer Guide
    - Updated the product scope, target user profile, value proposition, user stories, use cases and glossary of the Developer Guide
