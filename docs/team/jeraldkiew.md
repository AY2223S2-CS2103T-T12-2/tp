### Project: MedInfo

MedInfo is a desktop application for private hospital administrative staff. It helps manage patients,
their status, discharge dates and wards. MedInfo aims to solve the problem of slow, multiple step process of
documenting patient medical records during in-processing by zeroing in on the important details and provide simple,
fast access to a particular patientâ€™s medical records for hospital admin staff.

The user interacts with MedInfo using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
MedInfo is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
