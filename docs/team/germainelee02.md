### Project: AddressBook Level 3

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create GUI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability of list all the recipes.
  * What it does: Allows the user to list all the recipes stored in CookHub. The recipes listed out will also be indexed starting from 1.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to be able to view clearly all his/her recipes in CookHub. The user will then also be able to know the index of each recipe in CookHub, and can perform subsequent operations easily.
  * Highlights: This command is a fairy simple task. This is usually called before commands that require knowledge of the indexing of the recipes
