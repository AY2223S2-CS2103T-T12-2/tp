### Project: AddressBook Level 3

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create GUI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Modified Components**: Restructured the Parser component when modifying Address Book 3 to CookHub. [\#78](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/78)
  * What it does: This component is in charge of parsing the string received in the command line. It is supposed to parse the string in the command line, before calling the respective commands.
  * Justification: The Parser component needs to be restructured, along with all the components in the code base (i.e. `Logic`, `Ui`) because we are changing the model completely, 
  from a `Person` in AB3, to a `Recipe` in CookHub. Hence, the command flags parsed need to be changed, as well as the individual handling of the parsing of each command flag (e.g. Accepting multiple `i/`, but only one `t/`).
  As the model is changed completely, and Parser also heavily relies on Model, the Parser would consequently need to be completely restructured as well to suit our CookHub agenda.
  * Highlights: The learning curve of handling the Parser can be steep as first. When first faced with the code base, I had to learn how the different subcomponents of Parser works.
  Some notable ones are `ArgumentMultimap`, `ArgumentTokenizer`, and `ParserUtil`. I had to learn how `ParserUtil` parses each individual command flag inputs, as well as how `ArgumentMultimap`
  handles the respective input with respect to its command flags. Definitely, I had to do some trial and error. Reading the Developer Guide and tracing the entire code base when a command is passed in definitely helped me to understand the Parser component of the code base.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Modified the `find` command to handle a greater variety of inputs and command flags. [\#140](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/140)
  * What it does: The modified `find` command will be able to take in a command flag (e.g. `t/`, `d/`, `s/`, `i/`) and will be able to find through the respective components of a `Recipe`.
    For example, `find i/Eggs` will search through all the recipe ingredients, and list all the recipes with eggs as an ingredient. Similar to the `add` command
    and `edit` command, this modified `find` command makes good use of the pre-existing utility functions in `ArgumentMultimap` and `ArgumentTokenizer`.
    This command also has its own function to validate that only one command flag can be present, or it will throw an error. This command also has the function
    to get the predicate of its respective command flag.
  * Justification: Previously, the `find` command only searches through the titles of the recipes. However, we found that there is room for improvement in this command.
    During planning, my team decided that one important aspect of CookHub would be that a user can search through CookHub by its ingredients. The previous implementation of `find` does not cover that requirement.
    For example, if a user has eggs in the fridge that are near-expiry and wants to find a recipe that uses eggs, finding by title would result in recipes titled as
    `Omelette` not showing up. Hence, we want the user to be able to search through the entirety of a recipe, as well as its respective components.
  * Highlights: The challenge in this command is in adding the functionality of parsing the command flags given. This is because I wanted to make use of the existing utility
    classes such as `ArgumentMultimap` and `ArgumentTokenizer`. It also had to check that only one command flag was given before continuing on with the command parsing.
    Additionally, I created the respective classes to handle the predicates for each recipe component.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Modified the input rules for `Step` and `Description` [\#163](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/163)
  * What it does: After modification, `Step` and `Description` can now contain punctuation marks. Initially, the inputs can only be alphanumeric or spaces.
  * Justification: Naturally, a step should be able to contain puncatuation marks such as commas. Descriptions may also choose to contain punctuation marks. 
  There is no reason why a step or description should be devoid of punctuation marks
  * Highlights: This was a fairly simple task to do. This feature flaw was brought up 30 minutes before the feature freeze deadline. Luckily, I hurriedly relaxed the regex before the deadline.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for a user to find all the ingredients that can be made with only a set of ingredients. [\#140](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/140)
  * What it does: The `only` feature receives a list of ingredients, then lists all the recipes that can be made with only those ingredients.
    For example, the input `only eggs bacon tomatoes` will return a list of recipes that have a set of ingredients that are a subset of the ingredients mentioned.
    A recipe that contains any ingredients
    that are not mentioned will not be in the returned list. For example, if the user only has eggs, bacon, and tomatoes, any recipe including rice cannot be made as the user simply does not have that ingredient.
    Likewise, if the user only has eggs, bacons, and tomatoes, any recipe that only requires bacons can be made.
  * Justification: This command is aimed in helping our target audience, which are student chefs. This `only`  command helps to find recipes that can be made with only
    the ingredients mentioned, and nothing more. This helps the user be able to find recipes that they can make given their current ingredient situation.
  * Highlights: This command was definitely a more novel command. It works similarly to the original find command, but with certain modifications made.
    The respective predicate loops through all the recipe ingredients, and rejects a recipe if it finds an ingredient that is not in the mentioned list.

* **Modified Testing**: Redid the entire test code for Parser [\#108](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/108), [\#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/99)
  * I was in charge of redoing the entire Parser subsection of the test code. Not only did I have to redo all the command parser tests, I also had to change modify the files under the  
  `testutil` directory, as the test code uses the classes in the `testutil` directory heavily.
  * Justification: When restructuring the existing AB3 to fit our CookHub agenda, our test code started to break. It would be better to have a passing CI
  so that problems can be more easily detected in the workflow. If the CI is constantly failing due to failing tests, other problems could go unnoticed. Hence, because we wanted to be
  able to catch problems more easily in the future, we had to restructure the test code so that our CI can pass.

* **Modified Testing**: Redid the `CommandTestUtil` file [\#99](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/pull/99)
  * Decided all the parameters in `CommandTestUtil`, that will be used in the other test classes too
  * Justification: The parameters in the `CommandTestUtil` will be reused over and over again in the other test classes.
