### Project: CookHub

CookHub is a desktop application for student chefs to store and check their recipes, especially for those who only have limited budget and time to cook themselves.
It is written in Java and uses JavaFX to create GUI.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a recipe.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a recipe stored in CookHub. The indexes of the recipes will be shifted up after deletion.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to be able to remove outdated recipes to reduce clutter and avoid confusion. The shifting up of indexes will allow users to know the updated indices of each recipe in CookHub after deletion to perform subsequent operations easily.
