### Project: MedInfo

MedInfo is a desktop address book application used for patient information management. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. MedInfo can get your patient and ward management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `find` command
    * find the patient by searching for specific `name`, `nric`, `status` and `ward`.
  * `sort-by` command
    * sort the displayed list of patients by `name`, `status`, `ward name` and `discharge date` in `ascending` or `descending` order.
